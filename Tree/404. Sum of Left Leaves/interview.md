那么判断当前节点是不是左叶子是无法判断的，必须要通过节点的父节点来判断其左孩子是不是左叶子。

如果该节点的左节点不为空，该节点的左节点的左节点为空，该节点的左节点的右节点为空，则找到了一个左叶子，判断代码如下：


This problem asks us to find the sum of all left leaves in a binary tree.

My approach is to use recursion. Since it's a binary tree, it's intuitive to think about using recursion. First, if the current node is null, I just return 0.

Before I dive into the code, let me quickly talk about the three key steps for recursion:

1. First, we need to decide the parameters and the return value of our recursive function. Here, since we want to find the sum of left leaves, we need to pass in the root node of the tree, and the function should return an integer, which is the sum.

   In this problem, we can just use the function given by the problem: sumOfLeftLeaves(TreeNode root).

2. Next, we need to set the base case, or the stopping condition. If we reach a null node, that means there are no more nodes to check, so we return 0. Sometimes, people also check if the current node is a leaf node (both left and right are null), and return 0 in that case too. But actually, even if we don't write this extra check, the recursion still works, it just goes one level deeper.


3. Finally, we need to decide what to do in each recursive step. That's where we check if the left child is a left leaf, add its value if it is, and then keep searching both left and right subtrees.

Then, I recursively calculate the sum of left leaves in the left subtree and store it in leftValue.

The good thing about this method is that every node checks if its left child is a left leaf, and we use recursion to make sure we don't miss any left leaves in the whole tree.

This way, we can correctly get the sum of all left leaves.

For time complexity, we visit each node once, so it's O(n).
Space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree.


Now, let me walk you through the code step by step:

First, we check if the root is null. If it is, we just return 0, because there are no nodes in the tree.

Then, we call the function recursively on the left child and save the result in leftValue. This means we are looking for left leaves in the left subtree.

After that, we check if the left child exists, and if it is a leaf node (so both its left and right children are null). If that's true, we add its value to leftValue, because we found a left leaf.

Next, we do the same thing for the right subtree. We call the function recursively on the right child and save the result in rightValue.

At the end, we add leftValue and rightValue together and return the sum. This gives us the total sum of all left leaves in the tree.

So, the code follows the idea I just explained, and each part matches the steps in my approach.
