# Longest Consecutive Sequence - Interview Script

Let me start with the brute force solution. We need to traverse each number in the array. For each number, we traverse through all other numbers after this element to find if they form a sequence. For example, if we start at a number, we check if the next consecutive number exists in our array, then check for the next one, and so on. We keep track of the longest sequence we've found. This approach is straightforward but not very efficient, as we need to traverse through the array multiple times.

Now, let's improve this using a better approach. We can use a HashSet to make our solution more efficient. First, we put all numbers into a HashSet for quick lookups. Then, for each number in our array, we try to find if it's the start of a sequence. How do we know if it's a start? Well, if the number minus 1 doesn't exist in our set, then this number must be the start of a sequence.

When we find a start number, we can count forward from there. We keep checking if the next consecutive number exists in our set. For example, if we have the number 4, we check for 5, then 6, then 7, and so on, until we can't find the next number. This way, we only need to go through the array once, making our solution much more efficient.
