# Remove Element - Interview Script

"Let me walk you through my solution for this problem:

First, this is an array manipulation problem. We're given an array 'nums' and a target value 'val', and we need to remove all occurrences of 'val' from the array. The key constraint here is that we need to do this in-place, meaning we can't use any extra array space.

Let's start with the brute force approach. The simple way is to use a loop inside another loop. We first use one loop to check each element in the array. When we find an element that equals our target value, we need another loop to move all the elements after it one step forward. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(nÂ²), which isn't optimal.

So we can use the technique of two pointers. Why two pointers? Because it allows us to complete all operations in a single pass through the array, making it both efficient and space-compliant. 
We'll have a fast pointer and a slow pointer. The fast pointer is used to traverse and find the elements for our new array. Then we need to place these elements into the new array, and their positions are tracked using the slow pointer.

Although the problem requires in-place operations, let's first visualize the solution by drawing it on a whiteboard.

2. Here's how it works:
   - We use the fast pointer 'f' to scan the array
   - When we find an element that's not equal to val, we place it at the position of the slow pointer 's'
   - Then we increment the slow pointer
   - The fast pointer continues scanning

3. Let me illustrate with an example:
   Let's say we have array [3,2,2,3] and val = 3
   - Initially, s=0, f=0
   - First number is 3, equals val, so skip it and move the fast pointer forward
   - Find 2, not equal to val, place it at s's position, then move both pointers forward
   - Another 2, not equal to val, place it at s's position, then move both pointers forward
   - Last 3, equals val, skip it and move the fast pointer forward
   - Final array becomes [2,2,2,3], with first two elements being valid

4. Why is this approach efficient?
   - Time Complexity: O(n) as we only traverse the array once
   - Space Complexity: O(1) as we don't use any extra space

5. In an interview, I would also consider these edge cases:
   - Empty array: return 0
   - All elements equal to val: return 0
   - No elements equal to val: return original array length
   - Array with single element
