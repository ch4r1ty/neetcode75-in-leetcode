# Remove Element - Interview Script

"Let me walk you through my solution for this problem:

First, this is an array manipulation problem. We're given an array 'nums' and a target value 'val', and we need to remove all occurrences of 'val' from the array. The key constraint here is that we need to do this in-place, meaning we can't use any extra array space.

I'll solve this using the two-pointer approach. Why two pointers? Because it allows us to complete all operations in a single pass through the array, making it both efficient and space-compliant.

Let me break down my approach:

1. We'll use two pointers:
   - A slow pointer 'i' that keeps track of where we should place the next valid element
   - A fast pointer 'j' that scans through the array

2. Here's how it works:
   - We use the fast pointer 'j' to scan the array
   - When we find an element that's not equal to val, we place it at the position of the slow pointer 'i'
   - Then we increment the slow pointer
   - The fast pointer continues scanning

3. Let me illustrate with an example:
   Let's say we have array [3,2,2,3] and val = 3
   - Initially, i=0, j=0
   - First number is 3, equals val, so skip it (j++)
   - Find 2, not equal to val, place it at i's position, i++
   - Another 2, not equal to val, place it at i's position, i++
   - Last 3, equals val, skip it
   - Final array becomes [2,2,2,3], with first two elements being valid

4. Why is this approach efficient?
   - Time Complexity: O(n) as we only traverse the array once
   - Space Complexity: O(1) as we don't use any extra space

5. In an interview, I would also consider these edge cases:
   - Empty array: return 0
   - All elements equal to val: return 0
   - No elements equal to val: return original array length
   - Array with single element

The advantages of this solution are:
- Simple and intuitive implementation
- Optimal space efficiency
- Single pass through the array
- Maintains relative order of remaining elements

For follow-up questions like:
- What if we need to remove multiple different values?
- What if the array is sorted?
I can discuss those variations as well.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the solution?"
