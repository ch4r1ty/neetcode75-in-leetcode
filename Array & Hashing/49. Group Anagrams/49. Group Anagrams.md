So we want to group all anagrams with this particular count together.
Now, what if this count does not exist yet? 
In that case, we use a HashMap to store the grouped anagrams. 
If the key for a specific character count is not yet present in the map, 
we create a new empty list, an ArrayList, and associate it with the key.

Since character count arrays cannot directly serve as keys in a HashMap,
we convert them into a suitable format. 
A common solution is to transform the array into an immutable String using a StringBuilder. 
This ensures that the key is unique, immutable, and suitable for use in a HashMap.

So now in our dictionary, we have grouped the anagrams together, 
so we can just take result; 
we don’t need the keys anymore, 
we just want to return the values, 
which are the anagrams grouped together. 
So we can return that, and we’re actually finished. 
This is the most optimal method i can come up with,
whose time complexity is m⋅n, 
where m is the number of strings we’re given, 
and n is the average length of each string,
representing how many characters are in each string.
