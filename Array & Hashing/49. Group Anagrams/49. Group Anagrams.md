let's create our hashmap we'll call it result, 
and so what we're doing is we're mapping the character count of each string, 
and we're mapping that to the list
of anagrams. so to do that we of course have to go through 
every string that we're given in the input.

and we want to count how many of each character it has, 
so we'll have initially an array, 
we're going to have 0 in it, 
we're going to have 26 zeros right? 
because one for each character so from lowercase 'a'
all the way to lowercase z.
and now we want to go through every single character in each string, 
we want to count how many of each character, 
so in this case, we want to map a to index 0
and we want to map z to index 25
so how can we do that?

Well we can one way at least is just take the ascii
value of the current character we're at c, 
and then subtract the ascii value of lowercase character 'a', 
so as you can see lowercase 'a' minus lowercase 'a' is going to be 0, 
lowercase 'z' minus lowercase 'a' is going to be 25.
so we do have it correctly, because for example, 
let's just say,
lowercase 'a' is ascii value 80 and i don't know if
this is actually correct,
but it's just a random value, 
then b is going to be ascii value 81 and so on.
but if we want to map this to zero,
we know one way to do that is take 80 minus 80.
if we want to map lowercase b to 1,
we can take 81 minus 80, right?
That's basically what i'm doing here.

So we want to group all anagrams with this particular count together.
Now, what if this count does not exist yet? 
In that case, that's why we use a HashMap to store the grouped anagrams. 
If the key for a specific character count is not yet present in the map, 
we create a new empty list, an ArrayList, and associate it with the key.

Since character count arrays cannot directly serve as keys in a HashMap,
we convert them into a suitable format. 
A common solution is to transform the array into an immutable String using a StringBuilder. 
This ensures that the key is unique, immutable, and suitable for use in a HashMap.

So now in our map, we have grouped the anagrams together, 
then we can just take result; 
we don’t need the keys anymore, 
we just want to return the values, 
which are the anagrams grouped together. 
So we can return that, and we’re actually finished. 
This is the most optimal method i can come up with,
whose time complexity is m⋅n, 
where m is the number of strings we’re given, 
and n is the average length of each string,
representing how many characters are in each string.
