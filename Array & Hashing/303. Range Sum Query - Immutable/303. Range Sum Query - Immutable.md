# Range Sum Query - Immutable - Interview Script

Let me explain how to efficiently solve the range sum query problem. The brute force way is to sum up the elements from index left to right every time we get a query. However, this is not efficient if we have many queries, because each query could take O(n) time.

To optimize, we can use a prefix sum array. We preprocess the input array and build a prefix sum array, where each element at index i stores the sum of all elements from the beginning up to index i-1. Then, for any query [left, right], we can get the sum in O(1) time by subtracting the prefix sum at left from the prefix sum at right + 1.

This approach makes the query operation very efficient, and the preprocessing only takes O(n) time.
