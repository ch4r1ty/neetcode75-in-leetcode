# Spiral Matrix II - Interview Script

Let me explain how to generate an n x n matrix filled with numbers from 1 to n^2 in spiral order.

The idea is to simulate the process of filling the matrix layer by layer. We use four boundaries: left, right, top, and bottom. At each step, we fill the current top row from left to right, then the right column from top to bottom, then the bottom row from right to left, and finally the left column from bottom to top. After each direction, we move the corresponding boundary inward. We repeat this process until all numbers are filled.

This approach ensures that we fill the matrix in spiral order efficiently, and the time complexity is O(n^2).
