# Spiral Matrix II - Interview Script

Let me explain how I would solve this problem. The main idea here is pretty visual - imagine we're drawing squares, but we start from the outer edge and keep moving towards the middle, just like when you draw circles that get smaller and smaller. In each round, we need to fill in numbers in four directions: first we go right, then down, then left, and finally up.

What's interesting about this problem is that it's actually slightly easier than Spiral Matrix I, because here we're dealing with a square matrix. We just need to fill numbers from 1 to n², where n² is the total number of cells in our n×n grid.

There are some important details we need to consider. The trickiest part is handling the corner points where these four edges meet. Let me explain my approach: I'll use a half-open interval for each edge, meaning we won't include the last point of each edge in our current iteration. Instead, that corner point will be filled when we process the next edge. This helps us avoid duplicating values at the corners.

To implement this, I'll use two variables, let's say startX and startY, to keep track of where each square begins. Remember that? We have outside squares and inside squares, come come from outside to middle. I'll also use an offset variable to control how many elements we process in each loop/ As we move to inner squares, we need to fill fewer numbers, so this offset gets bigger.

Let me show you how it works with an example. When n = 3, we need to fill two squares - an outer square and a middle point. Let's start with the outer square first, then we'll move to the center:
- Going right: fill (0,0) and (0,1), leaving (0,2) for the next edge
- Going down: fill (0,2) and (1,2), leaving (2,2) for the next edge
- Going left: fill (2,2) and (2,1), leaving (2,0) for the next edge
- Going up: fill (2,0) and (1,0)

After we finish this outer square, we'll move inward to fill the inner square, which is just the center point (1,1) in this case.

We stop when our pointers cross each other (left > right or top > bottom). The time complexity is O(n²) since we need to fill every cell exactly once.

Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?
